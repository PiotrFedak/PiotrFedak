<h1>Hello! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40"/></h1>

Hi! I'm a Computer Science Engineer mainly working with technologies related to JavaScript, but I'm always open to learning something new.  
I hold the ISTQB¬Æ Certified Tester Foundation Level certification and enjoy working on both development and software testing.  
I‚Äôm into all things IT, broadly speaking.  
Feel free to reach out ‚Äî I don‚Äôt bite and would be happy to help with a project, especially if it involves testing!


## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the most interesting projects I‚Äôve worked on:

- **[NBAVerse](https://github.com/PiotrFedak/Thesis)** A project focused on NBA team statistics ‚Äì features an interactive map of NBA teams, detailed team and player data, player search, match history, and schedules. Built with React and Laravel.
- **[BLT](https://github.com/blumilksoftware/blt)**: Behat+Laravel toolbox, a package meant to streamline testing Laravel apps with Behat. This was my internship at Blumilk, during which I worked with another student on a package to help write faster tests for Laravel projects.
- **[Rozlewnia Perfum](https://rozlewnia-perfum-lubin.com/)**: A website for a local business in Lubin. In this commission, I learned a lot about SEO and improving the website's Google ranking.
- **[kibolApp](https://github.com/kibolApp/kibolApp)**: A project mapping Polish football clubs and showing safe zones for each football fan. Features include authentication, tests, an admin panel, club relations, favorite clubs, and a map created with Leaflet.
- **[ATLA_Card_Game_Website](https://github.com/PiotrFedak/ATLA_Card_Game_Website)**: A website showcasing two games from the Avatar universe (one mobile, one desktop). Also includes game history and user statistics.
