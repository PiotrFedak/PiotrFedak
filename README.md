<h1>Hello! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40"/></h1>

I am a computer science student mainly involved in creating websites.

<br>My journey with programming started in technical school back in **2017**, where I created my first poor-looking websites using HTML and CSS.  
Since then, Iâ€™ve explored a variety of fascinating areas, from building computers, working with Arduino, and experimenting with 3D printers to diving deeper into programming technologies like **Laravel** and **React**.

## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some of the most interesting projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

- Currently writing an engineering thesis on NBA team statistics.
- **[BLT](https://github.com/blumilksoftware/blt)**: Behat+Laravel toolbox, a package meant to streamline testing Laravel apps with Behat. This was my internship at Blumilk, during which I worked with another student on a package to help write faster tests for Laravel projects.
- **[Rozlewnia Perfum](https://rozlewnia-perfum-lubin.com/)**: A website for a local business in Lubin. In this commission, I learned a lot about SEO and improving the website's Google ranking.
- **[kibolApp](https://github.com/kibolApp/kibolApp)**: A project mapping Polish football clubs and showing safe zones for each football fan. Features include authentication, tests, an admin panel, club relations, favorite clubs, and a map created with Leaflet.
- **[ATLA_Card_Game_Website](https://github.com/PiotrFedak/ATLA_Card_Game_Website)**: A website showcasing two games from the Avatar universe (one mobile, one desktop). Also includes game history and user statistics.
